========================

Survey Gorilla Challenge brought to you by Team Awesome (Ryan Rebo, Pei Xiong Liu, Beverly Mah, and Stephen Roth)

Our site will allow people to sign up and create surveys with multiple-choice questions.  They will be able to take surveys anonymously or while signed in, which will allow them to view the surveys they've taken.  Users will be able to see the results of surveys they have created.

Our responsibilities are divided into two groups.  One group will work on User authentication, user database models, and related views.  The other will work on survey creation and question creation, along with related models and views.
